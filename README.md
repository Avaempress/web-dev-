Code Workflow
The Flask application you provided follows these steps:

Startup and Configuration:
The Flask application is initialized with the necessary configurations, including a secret key for flashing messages.
Home Route (/):

GET Request: When the user visits the home page, an HTML form is presented where they can upload two CSV files: one for groups and one for hostels.
POST Request: When the form is submitted:
The application checks if the files are part of the request and whether they are not empty.
It reads the CSV files into Pandas DataFrames (group_df and hostel_df).
It processes the data by calling the allocate_rooms function to create room allocations.
The resulting allocation DataFrame (allocation_df) is stored globally and displayed as an HTML table on the resulting page.
Room Allocation Logic (allocate_rooms):

Iterates over each group in the group DataFrame.
For each group, it calls find_suitable_hostel_room to find a suitable room based on the group's gender and the room's capacity.
If a suitable room is found, the group is allocated to the room; otherwise, it is marked as "Not Allocated".
Finding Suitable Hostel Room (find_suitable_hostel_room):

Filters the hostel DataFrame to find rooms that match the group's gender and have sufficient capacity.
Sorts the filtered DataFrame by capacity to find the smallest suitable room.
Returns the first suitable room found or None if no suitable room is available.
Download Allocation Route (/download_allocation):

Allows the user to download the allocation results as a CSV file.
Checks if the allocation DataFrame is available; if not, it returns an error message.
Converts the DataFrame to a CSV format and sends it as a downloadable file.
